# CS6700 - Fundamentals of Deep Learning
## Assignment 3

### Instructions for executing the program question-wise:

The code for the model is contained in the Python notebook **A3.ipynb**. 
The initial cells contain the code as developed during the coding phase.
The code for each question is separately contained in the final cells of the notebook. Each question is coded as a function, and the calls to all functions corresponding to the questions have been commented out. To execute a particular question, uncomment the corresponding function call and execute the cell.

**Note:** Ensure that the cells are executed in the order presented in the notebook. Not doing so may result in incorrect results and/or errors.
